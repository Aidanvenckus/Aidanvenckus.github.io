        I created a PCB of a circuit that I found fascinating in my capstone class for fun. This PCB is a IR Light detector which should be able to see IR from over 16 feet away. 
        I designed the circuit first on a breadboard before taking the schematic and using the PCB creation software EAGLE to make the digital schematic. I then converted the 
        digital schematic into a PCB design and designed it to be relatively compact but still easy to see where each of the PCB traces are going.

        This assignment was for us to design a practive bot that will be inspired on what we should be expecting for the final bot. I created this by using solidworks to design the 
        individual parts, assembled them together and made sure all the parts fit together. I then put all the parts on one plane and created a cutout design to then send to 
        the laser cutter.

        This assignment had us focus on creating a circuit from scratch for the purpose to read in IR signals and signal when they are seen. 
        It does this by using multiple stages such as a transresistive input, non inverting op amp stages for amplification, 
        a filtering stage by using a 4th order butterworth to only let in 2kHz signals, a peak detector, comparator with hysterisis with thresholds 
        set to be able to make it into a digital high-low signal, and lastly a LED to show the output.

        This assignment had us coding on a uno32 based dual motor robot called the roach. The goal of the roach is to "Run from the light, hide in the darkness" meaning using its 
        motors and light sensor we needed to navigate a maze that can change and have it adapt to find the shade everytime.
        This assignment had us practicing our skills in developing finite state machines (FSM), hierarchical state machines (HSM), and event driven programming with events handlers, service calls, and 
        timers instead of delays to prevent blocking code. <br/>
        The Gif below shows the final product of us using a right hand maze rule to navigate the course.

        I will be doing my Computer Engineering capstone this quarter. For the Capstone I decided to take the Mechatronics class that will likely 
        use every skill I've learned these past 3 years compressed into a 10 week course with multiple labs and a final project that will put all I know into a practical application.
        This course is a combination of Software Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Eletrical Engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Capstone Description:<br/>
        The class goal is to do 4 labs all of varying skills and then a final project which encorporates all the skills to one 5 week robot.</br>
        <br/>
        - Lab 0 Event Driven Programming - The Cockroach<br/>
        - Lab 1 Analog Signal Conditioning/Filtering<br/>
        - Lab 2 Mechanical and Electronic Prototyping<br/>
        - Lab 3 DC and Stepper Motors<br/>

      <h2 style="float: left">Air Traffic App Update </h2> <h5 style="float: right">Sep 21, 2021</h5>
      </div>
      <center><img style="border-radius: 20px;" src="Images/Plane3_2021-09-19.png"></center>
      <i>*bright-dark red triangles are high-low elevation airplanes, green triangle is user location, blue triangles are landed planes</i> <br/> <br/>

      <p>
        New update with the Air Traffic App includes planes showing their direction as a result of making the plane object into triangles and then 
        doing transformation(rotation) on the object per each planes directional data. The Planes also show elevation by different shades of red by 
        doing rgba(variable,0,0,1) when variable=(elevation*max_color_hue/highest_elevation). Another quality that was implemented was if the plane 
        was landed which was represented as a boolean value in the data.
      </p>
      <p>
        My favoite thing that I implemented so far was that when you hover on each one of the react plane objects I used a "onMouseEnter()" and 
        "onMouseLeave()" event to have a box apear with data of the planes numerical registration ID, latitude, longitude, elevation(m), and speed(m/s).
      </p>
      <p>
        Next steps in the Air Traffic App will be implementing the app to display airports which will likely require another API, database, or JSON file with the info. 
        Additionally I am in the progress of adding heatmaps to replace plane objects when an button is clicked which would show an interesting perspective of air traffic. 
        Lastly, I would also like to implement as an extra but not required feature of a unique speed and elevation change distinction such as another color, outline, or animation 
        (not actually sure what I plan to do yet) and I would like to display trails of planes (past flight) which will likely be small white lines or dots.

      <i>*Red dots are airplane positions, green dot is user location</i> <br/>
      <p>
        New update with the Air Traffic App include after researching for some time using the <a class="link" href="https://openskynetwork.github.io/opensky-api/">OpenSky Network API</a> 
        which utilizes my original choice of API the <a class="link" href="https://www.adsbexchange.com/data/">ADS-B API</a> however this API requires payment so I went with the free alternitive 
        because I am doing this just for fun&#47;practice&#47;hobbie.
      </p>
      <p>
        The OpenSky Network API which relies on ADS-B API, tracks 
        each aircraft (transponder) to a unique address (ICAO 24-bit) which is an aircraft&#39;s unique identifier (sometimes called 
        mode-s and is the aircraft&#39;s certificate of registration). The API then gathers the elevation, latitude, longitude, 
        direction, and other characteristics from other APIs and volenteers across the world who supply the data through Raspberry 
        Pis with an SDR and Antenna, so military and other filtered aircraft can be often seen (public tracking).
      </p>
      <p>
        With the API I was able to access each aircraft's icao24(Unique ICAO 24bit address of transponder), 
        callsign, origin country, time per position, last contact, longitude, latitude, latitude(barometer and geo), status if 
        its landed, velocity(m/s), direction, rate of elevation change, sensors, squawk, spi(special purpose indicator), and what 
        sorce is tracking it. For the time being I only got the the aircraft location to be displayed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next steps in the Air Traffic App will be to implement more of the data onto the air traffic display. The data I plan to use 
        first will be to change the shade of the dots based on elevation diffrences, show direction by using an object other than a circle 
        and the data I have, have an indicator if the plane has landed.

      <h2 style="float: left">Air Traffic App (previously: Geolocation API)</h2> <h5 style="float: right">Sep 5, 2021</h5>
      <center><img style="border-radius: 20px;" src="Images/Location_2021-09-5.png"></center>
      <i>*red dot is user location</i> <br/>
      <p>
        The Air Traffic App first started as a progression from the Geolocation App. I started the 
        Geolocation App as a way to practice my newly founded skills in React and Javascript while 
        practicing working with APIs.
      </p>
      <p> 
        The current version uses the 
        <a class="link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API">Geolocation API</a> by Mozilla which asks 
        for your location permission and then returns it as a latitude, longitude, and accuracy based on your 
        your using your computer or phones GPS if available. If not avaliable, it uses its WIFI signal. 
        If using a mobile signal, the position is triangulated by cell towers to work out the closest latitude 
        and longitude it can determine.
      <p>
        The App also works with the 
        <a class="link" href="https://github.com/google-map-react/google-map-react">google-maps-react API</a> 
        which is a subset of 
        google maps API but, uses a smaller portion of the full API and allows for react objects to be added 
        (will be important when planes need to be added).
      </p>  
      <p>
        Although this was the end of the Geolocation App, I 
        used the Geolocation code to start a Plane Traffic App which will need plane location data for the next step.

      <h2 style="float: left"> Homemade Osilliscope ("denoted: TinyScope") </h2> <h5 style="float: right">June 10, 2021</h5>
      <center><img style="border-radius: 20px;" src="Images/Tinyscope_Overview.png"></center> 
      <i> After I finished the prototype I rewired and shoved all the components into tupperware to keep it protected and compact.</i> <br/> <br/>
      <center><img style="border-radius: 20px;" src="Images/Tinyscope.png"></center>
      <p>
        The TinyScope was my final project for my Embedded Systems Design course (CSE121) at UCSC
        The Tinyscope is made from a PSoC-6 microcontroller that runs C code programmed and compiled in the PSoC Creator.
      </p>
      <p> 
        The TinyScope has features similar to those found in a lab osilliscope with the only restriction being that the board could 
        not handle above 5V.
      <p>
        The TinyScope featured 2 Waveform Channels with a sampling rate of 250k samples/second for all 4 ADC channels. <br/>
        - 2 Channels for Analog Signals <br/>
        - 2 Channels for Potentiometers’ Readings <br/>
        2 Waveform Modes (Free-Running & Triggered) <br/>
        User Input to alter Waveform <br/>
        - Xscaling<br/>
        - Yscaling<br/>
        - Trigger Level<br/>
        - Trigger Slope<br/>
        - Waveform Stopped / Started<br/>
        Frequency Calculation<br/>
        Scrolling Waveforms (via Potentiometers)<br/>
      </p>  
      <p>
        Unfortunately I cannot display the full code as it could be an assignment for future quarters and that would be a lapse of academic integrity
