ToDo:

- Have the homepage have a whole bunch of Icons for projects and go to's instead of drop down menu potentially.
- Fill out descriptions on projects.
- Have it where if you onclick the PCB picture it shows the backside instead of front
- Need to do javascript to count # of character in each title and use typewriter
- Maybe I should only do highlights on the front page.
- Fix the UI of the Webapp, it is different from the site.
- Change Webapp 3D Scan Projects HTML to 3D Models
